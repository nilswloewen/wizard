Wizard is my favourite card game, as you can win even when dealt bad cards - just like in life. 

The goal of this project is for me to learn Rust lang. Wizard is a small, achievable goal. 

###Goal 1: 
 - Terminal based 1 player game.

###Goal 2: 
 - Web based game using [Rocket.rs](https://rocket.rs/) and html forms.
   
###Goal 3: 
 - Web based game with client-side WASM written in Rust.
