Wizard is my favourite card game, as you can win even if delt bad cards - just like in life. 

The goal of this project is for me to learn Rust lang. Wizard is a small, achievable goal. 

Goal 1: Terminal based 1 player game.
Goal 2: Web based 1 player game using html forms.
Goal 3: Web based 1 player game with client-side WASM written in Rust.
